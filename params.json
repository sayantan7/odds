{"name":"O D D S","tagline":"Online Drug Delivery System","body":"### Welcome to Online Drug Delivery System GitHub Pages.\r\nThis is going to be my platform for feeds as well as general instructions for novices (including your truly) to integrate git with eclipse. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are loads of tutorials out there. If you already have a working git/egit setup, you should only seldom need to visit this page, only in case of some stupid/unusually stupid errors.\r\n\r\n### Target Audience\r\nSomeone having knowledge of one or more of the following technologies:\r\nCoding:\r\nHTML5, Java, J2EE, Spring MVC, Struts2, Hibernate, Socket IO\r\nContent Generation:\r\nMedical Content.\r\nHardware:\r\nRaspberry Pi. \r\n\r\n### Template files\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can add your code and pages to enhance the functionalities of various modules. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub. Just thought of mentioning that. It was used by only a few people, but the developer community joined hands and we all know where GitHub stands today. \r\nI, Sayantan Ghosh (@suvo) found ODDS (just because I was pretty jobless.) \r\nI would like to call on my fellow developers to come join hands and help me (because I am lazy and dont't want to do it all alone) create a better future for all those who can't afford the riches of a five star personalized treatment.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and theyâ€™ll help you sort it out. :P\r\nYou can also reach out to me at zayantan@gmail.com; but expect a delayed reply.","google":"UA-42734170-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
